# Programming1
To run the program first you need to create the new folder and then go to that folder. At that folder you use "git clone https://github.com/Logan-Ph/Programming1.git" to clone the repo into that foler. Then use the Intelliji (whatever edition) (or other IDE)  to open the folder you just cloned 


For exp: i created the folder 'Pro1'. Then I go to that folder and use the "git clone https://github.com/Logan-Ph/Programming1.git". After that the folder 'Programming1' (the folder of the repo) will be downloaded inside the folder I just created 'Pro1'. Then use the Intelliji (whatever edition) (or other IDE) 
to open the folder 'Programming1' (the folder of the repo). And then go the "Main.java" to run the whole system
